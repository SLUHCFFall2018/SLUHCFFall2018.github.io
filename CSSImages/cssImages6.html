    <p> Welcome to my page with a background image. The image is not a repeating image. It has been placed in a certain position on the page. This technique is really
    best for semi-transparent images with spare graphics.</p>

    <p>It is best to change the opacity of the picture using Photoshop or another graphics editing program. Changing the contrast or opacity of the picture will make
    the text more readable. </p>
