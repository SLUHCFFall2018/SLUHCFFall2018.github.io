    <h3>Below I made the list horizontal and I hid the third item in the list. Check out the css code to see how I did it.</h3>

    <h3>This paragraph is not centered.</h3>

    <p>The St. Louis area receives a lot of rain. Some other parts of the country don't receive nearly the amount that St. Louis does.
        Even in the summer when it is very hot, a thunderstorm can move through and produce more than an inch of rain. During the fall
        rain showers come and go. Although St. Louis does'nt receive much snow, the rain it receives throughout the year accounts for
        the large amount of percepitation that falls in St. Louis.
