    <h4>This page will illustrate some of the other features of html that we have not yet covered. Many of these features don't fit into a neatly defined category.</h4>

    <hr  width="80%" color="red" size="10" />

    <h4>Every html element can have an "id" attribute. The "id" attribute uniquely identifies that element from other elements on the page. No two elements on a page can have the same "id"</h4>

    <h4>An "id" attribute allows us to style an element using CSS and it allows javascript to modify an element. The "id" attribute is known as a <em>global attribute</em> because it can be used on any element.</h4>

    <hr  width="80%" color="green" size="10" />

    <h4>Every html element can also have a "class" attribute. This is not used to uniquely identify an element but rather to indicate that an element is part of a group or "class" of elements. </h4>

    <h4>The "class" attribute also allows us to style and element using CSS and it allows javascript to modify an element.</h4>

    <hr  width="80%" color="blue" size="10" />

    <h4>The div tag is allows you to group a set of elements together into one <em>block-level</em> element. Rememeber, block-level elements always have a new line inserted after them.</h4>

    <h4>The div tag is an organizational element and does not make a difference in the way an element appears by itself.</h4>

    <h4>Using an "id" or "class" attribute with a div tag allows you to style or position all elements within a div tag. </h4>

    <br /><br />

    <div>
      <h4>The reasons I love pepperoni pizza</h4>
      <img src="lunch.jpg" alt="a pepperoni pizza" width="20%" height="20%" />
      <ul>
        <li>It's cheesy.</li>
        <li>It's doughy.</li>
        <li>It's warm</li>
        <li>Pepperoni is spicy.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <hr  width="80%" color="yellow" size="10" />

    <h4>The span tag allows you to group a set of elements together into one <em>inline-level</em> element. Remember, inline-level elements do not have a new line inserted after them.</h4>

    <h4>Like the div tag, the span tag is an organizational element and does not make a difference in the way an element appears by itself.</h4>

    <h4>Also, like the div tag, using an "id" or "class" attribute with a span tag allows you to style or position all elements within a span tag. </h4>

    <h4>The paragraph below has a span tag in it. Look at the source code to see it used. Most of the time a span tag would have an "id" or "class" attribute but in the example below, it does not.</h4>

    <p>The other day I was walking around my yard and I noticed that there were little trails in the grass. I followed the trails as they created branching paths in my grass. I noticed that at one point
      all the little trails converged to a common trail. The main trail led to a small opening by the retaining wall on the East side of my backyard. I realized that some creature, <span>probably a
      field mouse</span>, was living in my backyard and making trails to his favorite spots in my yard.

    <h4>iframes are used to present another web page inside of you current web page using a window effect. May people use iframes to put maps into a web page. Look at the source code to examine
