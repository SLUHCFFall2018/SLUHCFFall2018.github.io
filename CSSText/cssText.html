    <h2>SLUH Ski Club</h2>

    <h3>What is it?</h3>

    <p class="format1 first">The SLUH club goes to Hidden Valley Ski Resort. We obtain a discounted rate on a "one day per week" season pass. This usually costs about $150.
      If you want to rent equipment, then you pay and extra $20 just one time for the whole season. In other words, renting equipment costs $20 for
    the whole season. Normally, it costs $25 each visit to rent equipment.</p>

    <p class="format2 second"> The typical length of the ski season in St. Louis is about 8 weeks. Because St. Louis doesn't get a lot of snow, Hidden Valley
      Ski resort has to make its own snow. If the temperature is below 25 degrees, then snow can be made and distributed on the slopes of
      Hidden Valley. </p>
